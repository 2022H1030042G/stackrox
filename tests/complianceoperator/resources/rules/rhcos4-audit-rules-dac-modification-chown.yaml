description: |-
  At a minimum, the audit system should collect file permission changes for all users and root. If the auditd daemon is configured to use the augenrules program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the default), add the following line to a file with suffix.rules in the directory /etc/audit/rules.d :

  -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S chown -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -F key=perm_mod

  If the system is 64 bit then also add the following line:

  -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S chown -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -F key=perm_mod

  If the auditd daemon is configured to use the auditctl utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to /etc/audit/audit.rules file:

  -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S chown -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -F key=perm_mod

  If the system is 64 bit then also add the following line:

  -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S chown -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -F key=perm_mod

rationale: The changing of file permissions could indicate that a user is attempting
  to gain access to information that would otherwise be disallowed. Auditing DAC modifications
  can facilitate the identification of patterns of abuse among both authorized and
  unauthorized users.

warning: Note that these rules can be configured in a number of ways while still achieving
  the desired effect. Here the system calls have been placed independent of other
  system calls. Grouping these system calls with others as identifying earlier in
  this guide is more efficient.
