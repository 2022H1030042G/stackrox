description: Consider the use of an external secrets storage and management system,
  instead of using Kubernetes Secrets directly, if you have more complex secret management
  needs. Ensure the solution requires authentication to access secrets, has auditing
  of access to and use of secrets, and encrypts secrets. Some solutions also make
  it easier to rotate secrets.

rationale: Kubernetes supports secrets as first-class objects, but care needs to be
  taken to ensure that access to secrets is carefully limited. Using an external secrets
  provider can ease the management of access to secrets, especially where secrets
  are used across both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments.
