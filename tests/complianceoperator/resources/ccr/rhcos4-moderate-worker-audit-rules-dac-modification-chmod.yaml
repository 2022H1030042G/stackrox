  Record Events that Modify the System's Discretionary Access Controls - chmod
  The changing of file permissions could indicate that a user is attempting to
  gain access to information that would otherwise be disallowed. Auditing DAC modifications
  can facilitate the identification of patterns of abuse among both authorized and
  unauthorized users.
id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_audit_rules_dac_modification_chmod
instructions: |-
  To determine if the system is configured to audit calls to the
  chmod system call, run the following command:
  preserve$ sudo grep "chmod" /etc/audit/audit.*
  If the system is configured to audit this activity, it will return a line.

- Note that these rules can be configured in a number of ways while still achieving
  the desired effect. Here the system calls have been placed independent of other
  system calls. Grouping these system calls with others as identifying earlier in
  this guide is more efficient.
