  Consider external secret storage
  Kubernetes supports secrets as first-class objects, but care needs to be
  taken to ensure that access to secrets is carefully limited. Using an
  external secrets provider can ease the management of access to secrets,
  especially where secrets are used across both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes
  environments.
