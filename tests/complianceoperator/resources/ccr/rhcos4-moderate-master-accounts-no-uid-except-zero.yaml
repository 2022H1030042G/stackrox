description: |-
  Verify Only Root Has UID 0
  An account has root authority if it has a UID of 0. Multiple accounts
  with a UID of 0 afford more opportunity for potential intruders to
  guess a password for a privileged account. Proper configuration of
  sudo is recommended to afford multiple system administrators
  access to root privileges in an accountable manner.
id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_accounts_no_uid_except_zero
instructions: |-
  To list all password file entries for accounts with UID 0, run the
  following command:
  $ awk -F: '($3 == \"0\") {print}' /etc/passwd
  This should print only one line, for the user root.

  If there is a finding, change the UID of the failing (non-root) user. If
  the account is associated with the system commands or applications the UID
  should be changed to one greater than 0 but less than
  1000. Otherwise assign a UID of greater than 1000 that
  has not already been assigned.
