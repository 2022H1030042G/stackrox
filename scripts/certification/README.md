# Red Hat Scanner Certification

Upon major changes to our RHEL image scanning functionality
or updates to the certification program, we must resubmit results
to Red Hat (see the steps linked below for the team/email address).

We only need to follow steps 3 - 8 from the
[certification workflow](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/partner-guide-red-hat-vulnerability-scanner-cert/workflow).

## How to Use

1. Start rox locally
1. Run `./run.sh <central-endpoint> [<central-password>]`
   * `<central-password>` is not required if `ROX_API_TOKEN` is set.
1. Send the output CSV files to Red Hat
